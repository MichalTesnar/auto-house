# Doing

# Todo
- [ ] Use a model that parses images, and scrape the images of the places for the model as well.
- [ ] Get a scout to look at pages and get updates, pass that to a server
- [ ] Parse the HTML better for the LLM for WohnenETHZ
- [ ] Add Image to Email As attachment
- [ ] Add link to the saved file for faster lookup
- [ ] Timestamp emails and messages saved

# Not Urgent
- [ ] Test in WebInteractor that you have reached the give step for each function (using HTML headers?)
- [ ] Fix tests so that they can be run from main directory
